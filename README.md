# Mouse_Seurat_Clustering
In this repository, the main code for the clustering is saved. 

There are different files in this repo:

-   arraytogenecounts.R            -->   This file converts the array data to genecount matrixes.
-   Mouse_Remove_BatchEffect.R     -->   This file consists of the batch removal of GSE66569 dataset.
-   SeuratIntegration.R            -->   This file contains Mouse clustering of GSE66569, mouse differential gene expression, Mouse pathway analysis, Mouse Correlation to physiological measurements, Expression of markers and the closest correlating human plaque type code.
-   Pathway_Comparison_Heatmaps.R  -->   This file contains the pathway comparison between mouse and human and the pathway correlation.
